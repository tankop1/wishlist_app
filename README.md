Wishlist Travel App
By Tanner Kopel

This was the very first Flask app I ever created.
It is a simple website that allows the user to create a list of the locations they wish to travel. The first page includes a small description of the website, though most of the wording is only there to add a real feal to the site. The second page is where users can add to or view their wishlist, and the third page allows the user to add to or view a list of locations they've visited.

I hope you enjoy!
